# BurgerBoy
A 2D endless platformer developed in using C# in Unity for those who love their grub.

### Instructions
Here, you play as BurgerBoy - a nice, round boy (inspired from yours truly) who goes around the rooftops of the city eating as many burgers as he can - but beware! If you fall down, or even worse, like seriously, much, much worse, touch a treadmill *gasps*, it is Game Over. 

How long can you last? 

Note: It's a Windows build. Space is jump, it's the only control you need.
